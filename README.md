# Bubble-Sort-Algorithm
This repository contains a simple C program implementing the Bubble Sort algorithm. Bubble Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
The bubble_sort function takes an array of integers and its size as input parameters and sorts the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
The main function initializes an array of integers with some values, calls the bubble_sort function to sort the array, and then prints the sorted array to the console.
