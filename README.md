# Bubble-Sort-Algorithm
This repository contains a simple C program implementing the Bubble Sort algorithm. Bubble Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
